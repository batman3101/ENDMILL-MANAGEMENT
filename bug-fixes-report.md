## üêõ Bug #1: Logic Error in Stock Status Calculation

**File:** `app/api/inventory/route.ts`  
**Lines:** 91-96  
**Severity:** High  
**Type:** Logic Error

### Problem Description
The `getStockStatus` function has a logical error in determining stock levels. The function incorrectly calculates the "high" stock threshold using `max * 0.9`, but this creates an inconsistent range where stock levels between `min * 1.5` and `max * 0.9` would be classified as "normal", even when the maximum stock is lower than 1.5 times the minimum stock.

### Current Buggy Code
```typescript
function getStockStatus(current: number, min: number, max: number): string {
  if (current <= min) return 'critical';
  if (current <= min * 1.5) return 'low';
  if (current >= max * 0.9) return 'high';  // BUG: This logic is flawed
  return 'normal';
}
```

### Issues
1. **Gap in logic**: If `min * 1.5 > max * 0.9`, some stock levels won't be properly categorized
2. **Inconsistent thresholds**: The multipliers (1.5 and 0.9) may not make sense for all inventory scenarios
3. **No validation**: The function doesn't validate that `min < max`

### Impact
- Incorrect stock status reporting
- Potential missed alerts for low or high stock situations
- Inconsistent inventory management decisions

## üêõ Bug #2: Race Condition in CAM Sheets Local Storage

**File:** `lib/hooks/useCAMSheets.ts`  
**Lines:** 41-49, 52-58  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Type:** Race Condition/Data Corruption

### Problem Description
The CAM sheets hook has a race condition where multiple rapid updates to the same data can result in data loss or corruption. The `loadCAMSheetsFromStorage` and `saveCAMSheetsToStorage` functions don't handle concurrent access properly, and there's no error recovery mechanism if localStorage operations fail.

### Current Buggy Code
```typescript
const saveCAMSheetsToStorage = (camSheets: CAMSheet[]) => {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return
  
  try {
    localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEYS.CAM_SHEETS, JSON.stringify(camSheets))
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('CAM Sheets Ï†ÄÏû• Ïã§Ìå®:', error)
    // BUG: No error recovery or user notification
  }
}
```

### Issues
1. **No atomic operations**: Multiple simultaneous writes can corrupt data
2. **Silent failures**: Save failures are only logged, not handled
3. **No data validation**: Corrupted data in localStorage isn't detected
4. **Memory leaks**: Large objects in localStorage without cleanup

### Impact
- Data loss during rapid user interactions
- Corrupted CAM sheet data
- Poor user experience with silent failures
- Potential browser storage quota issues

## üêõ Bug #3: Security Vulnerability - Environment Variables Exposure

**File:** `lib/supabase/client.ts`  
**Lines:** 3-4  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Type:** Security Vulnerability

### Problem Description
The Supabase client configuration exposes sensitive environment variables in client-side code. While `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables are intentionally public, the error handling and validation could expose sensitive information, and there's no proper fallback for missing environment variables in production.

### Current Buggy Code
```typescript
const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!;
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!;

if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseAnonKey) {
  throw new Error('Missing Supabase environment variables'); // BUG: Exposes env var names
}
```

### Issues
1. **Information disclosure**: Error messages reveal environment variable names
2. **No graceful degradation**: App crashes completely if env vars are missing
3. **Client-side exposure**: Sensitive configuration details in client bundle
4. **No runtime validation**: Environment variables aren't validated for format/correctness

### Impact
- Potential information leakage about infrastructure
- Complete application failure in misconfigured environments
- Security reconnaissance opportunities for attackers
- Poor user experience during configuration issues

## üìä Summary

| Bug | Type | Severity | Status |
|-----|------|----------|--------|
| Stock Status Logic | Logic Error | High | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| CAM Sheets Race Condition | Data Corruption | Medium | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Environment Variables | Security | Critical | ‚úÖ Fixed |

## üîç Additional Issues Found

During the analysis, several other potential issues were identified:

1. **Console Statements in Production**: Multiple `console.log` statements found in production code that should be removed or replaced with proper logging
2. **Missing Type Definitions**: Some files missing proper TypeScript type definitions (e.g., @types/node)
3. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling patterns across the codebase
4. **Performance**: Large Excel template data stored in memory could be optimized

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

All three critical bugs have been successfully fixed:

1. **Stock Status Logic**: Implemented proper validation, consistent threshold calculations, and boundary condition handling
2. **CAM Sheets Storage**: Added debounced saving, data validation, error recovery, and storage quota management  
3. **Environment Variables**: Implemented secure error handling, runtime validation, and graceful degradation

The fixes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving the robustness, security, and reliability of the application. Minor linter warnings remain but do not affect functionality.
